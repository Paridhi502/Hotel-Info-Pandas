# Hotel-Info-Pandas
The following is a small project where I put my basics of pandas into use.
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.
Using various functions in Pandas I have tried to answer the questions asked in the excercise.
